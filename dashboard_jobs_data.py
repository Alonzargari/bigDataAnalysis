        In today's world, finding a job is not just about sending out resumes â€“ it's a complex process influenced by many factors:<br>
        supply and demand in the market, experience requirements, salary, location, and gender preferences. All these factors can affect the chances of finding the right job at the right time.<br><br>
        Job seekers are often interested in labor market research and may have many questions:<br>
        * How many job openings are posted in the leading economies of the world? Where does Israel stand in comparison, and which companies are the leaders in these countries?<br>
        * Does experience really matter? Candidates starting out might find that most jobs require experience, but are there industries willing to train new employees?<br>
        * What about salary? No one wants to work for a low salary, but is there really a difference between companies? Do big companies pay more than small ones?<br>
        * Gender discrimination â€“ myth or reality? Are there jobs aimed at a specific gender? Are certain industries more open to women or men?<br>
        * Where is it most worthwhile to search? There are many job search platforms, but which ones actually post the most job openings?<br><br>
        To answer these questions, we did a big data analysis that can give us a clear picture of work market.
